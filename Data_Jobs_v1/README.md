## Introduction
As a data analyst looking to build a strong portfolio, I created this dashboard to help **Job Seekers, Career Switchers**, and anyone curious about the data job market get quick, clear insights without needing to dig through scattered information.

I worked with a *real-world dataset containing job postings from 2024*, including job titles, locations, and salaries, following the full data analytics workflow, from data cleaning to dashboard design, to bring everything together in one interactive report.

## 🧰 Skills & Tools Applied

- **⚙️ Data Preparation (Power Query):** Cleaned and transformed the raw data (handled missing values, updated data types, and added custom columns), to make the dataset analysis-ready.

- **🧮 DAX Measures:** Built key metrics like Yearly Median Salary, Job Count, and more using implicit and calculated measures.

- **📊 Visualizations:** Used a mix of bar, column, line, and area charts to highlight trends and comparisons across job roles and time periods.

- **🗺️ Maps:** Created geospatial visuals to explore how data roles are spread globally.
- **🔢 KPIs & Tables:** Added cards to show important metrics at a glance and tables for users to explore detailed, sortable job information.

- **🎨 Dashboard Layout:** Focused on a clean and user-friendly design, combining common and creative chart types to tell the story effectively.

- **🖱️ Interactivity:**

  - **Slicers:** To filter jobs by title.

  - **Buttons & Bookmarks:** For smooth navigation between report pages.

  - **Drill-Through:** Let users dig deeper from summaries into detailed job breakdowns.
